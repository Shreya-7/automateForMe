# Subtitle Downloader

Run **`python3 subtitle.py "movie"`** in the same directory as the program file.

---

- Downloads the highest rated English language subtitle file from [YTS Subs](https://yts-subs.com/).
- Extracts into the `output` directory and renames the .srt file to the movie name.
- Apart from the obvious automated behaviour, also prevents dealing with the shady redirects and ads present on such websites.

**TODOS**:  
[ ] Add support for Subscene as backup  
[ ] Add option to specify language  
[ ] Add file input if needed
