This repository contains programs I created to automate a few simple everyday tasks which otherwise take up a lot of time for me. Currently, it has 5 kinds of activities it automates:

1. ## Course Search:
   - Opens search results from a variety of educational course websites for a particular topic with a filter applied for free courses.
   - README file
2. ## Directory Rename & Cleanup:
   - Created to make uniform names for folders and files associated with downloaded movies and TV shows.
   - It has two parts - one for movies and one for TV shows
   - README file
3. ## University Report Entry:
   - Fills up entries for MAKAUT reports.
   - Does everything from login to multiple report entries automatically, except the input for choosing faculty & datetime.
   - README file
4. ## Job Search:
   - Opens search results from a variety of job sites + company websites with a pre-set of filters.
   - README file
5. ## Guitar Tutorial Search:
   - Based on a given song and artist, opens guitar tutorials (tabs & chords) from Youtube channels, Youtube general results, and Ultimate Guitar.
